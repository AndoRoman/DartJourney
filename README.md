## Introduction

Dart and Flutter have become essential tools for building cross-platform mobile and web applications. This repository serves as my personal journal as I dive into Dart and Flutter development. I will document my learning experiences, share the challenges I encounter, and showcase the projects I build along the way.


## My Learning Path

My Dart and Flutter journey is a continuous learning process. I'm taking the following steps to master these technologies:

- **Tutorials and Courses**: I'm following tutorials and online courses to build a solid foundation in Dart and Flutter.

- **Project-Based Learning**: I believe in learning by doing, so I'm working on various projects to apply what I've learned.

- **Open Source Contributions**: I plan to contribute to open-source Dart and Flutter projects to gain practical experience and give back to the community.

## Projects

In this repository, you'll find a collection of Dart and Flutter projects I've worked on. These projects range from simple apps to more complex applications. Each project comes with its own README and source code for you to explore.

- ###  [Project 1](#): **To Do App / Task Manager**
**Explanation:** Build a task manager app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Implement features like task prioritization, due dates, and task categories. Use local storage or databases for persistent data storage.

 **Technicalities Involved:**

	 - User interface design with list view or grid view for tasks. 
	 - Handling user input for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. 
	 - Utilizing local storage or databases to store task data securely.

 - ### [Project 2](#): **Weather Forecast App**
 **Explanation:** Create an app that fetches weather data from a weather API and displays current conditions, hourly forecasts, and weekly forecasts in an appealing user interface. Implement location services to provide weather based on the user‚Äôs location.

 **Technicalities Involved:**

	- Making HTTP requests to a weather API to fetch data.
	- Parsing JSON or XML responses from the API to extract weather information.
	- Using location services to determine the user‚Äôs geographical coordinates.

 -  ### [Project 3](#): **Expense Tracker App**

**Explanation:** Develop an expense tracker that enables users to log and categorize their expenses. Implement graphical representation of spending patterns over time using charts or graphs.

**Technicalities Involved:**

		- Building a user interface for adding and categorizing expenses.
